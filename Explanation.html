	<h3>Academic Paper Explained: </h3> <h4>ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional
Neural Networks</h4>
<pre>
	Context
		- Image classification is hard
		- Traditionally done by passing a heavily pre-processed image into some classifier

	Neural Networks
		- How a neural network works
		- Transforming an inputs into linearly separable classes 
		- Why depth matters
		- How a convolutional neural network works

	SuperVision
		- The competition, dataset
		- SuperVision's performance
		- Discussion of results and why they're so special
	
	Technical Details
		- ReLUs and saturation -- need to talk to someone about the intuition behind this
		- Local Response Normalization -- I believe this is across the same kernels adjacent in image-space
		- Using GPUs for training -- paralellization of matrix operations, powers of two...
		- Data augmentation
		- Dropout (compare with denoising autoencoders?)

	Some kind of conclusion, perhaps?
